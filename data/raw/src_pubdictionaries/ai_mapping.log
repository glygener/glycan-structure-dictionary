"The candidate term \"blood group A type 1\" is an exact match to an existing term in the database (UUID: ae80aeaa-7f09-4089-bbf8-f939ca66e601). Therefore, it should be mapped to this existing term."

Processing term: blood group A type 1 (difucosyl)
"The candidate term \"blood group A type 1 (difucosyl)\" is more specific than the existing \"blood group A type 1\" in the database, as it specifies a difucosylated form. Therefore, it should be added as a new term."

Processing term: blood group A type 2
"The candidate term \"blood group A type 2\" is an exact match to an existing term in the database. Therefore, it should be mapped to the existing term with UUID 48d6e2a5-4952-47e2-8500-2570e071f47c."

Processing term: blood group A type 2 (difucosyl)
"The candidate term \"blood group A type 2 (difucosyl)\" does not exactly match any existing terms in the database. While \"blood group A type 2\" is present, the \"(difucosyl)\" specification makes this a more specific structure. Therefore, I will add \"blood group A type 2 (difucosyl)\" as a new term."

Processing term: blood group A type 3
"The candidate term \"blood group A type 3\" is an exact match to an existing term in the database. It should be mapped to the existing term with UUID eee3138f-0bab-4932-b162-1beac3aae6c3."

"The candidate term \"chondroitin sulfate D\" does not have a close or exact match among the existing terms in the database. It is a specific subtype of chondroitin sulfate with a distinct sulfation pattern, which is not represented by the more general or other subtype terms listed. Therefore, \"chondroitin sulfate D\" should be added as a new term."

Processing term: 1-6 beta galactan
"The candidate term \"1-6 beta galactan\" is best mapped to the existing term \"1-6-linked β-galactose\" (UUID: 165697ec-4d3c-5222-b659-a519d5f852b1), as it refers to β-D-galactose residues connected through 1-6 glycosidic bonds, which matches the description and intent of the candidate term."

Processing term: beta 1-4 galactan
"The candidate term \"beta 1-4 galactan\" does not exactly match any of the existing terms in your database. While \"galactan\" is a general term for galactose polymers, \"beta 1-4 galactan\" specifies the linkage type, which is not captured by any of the current entries. Therefore, I have added \"beta 1-4 galactan\" as a new term."

Processing term: 1-3,1-4 beta glucan
"The candidate term \"1-3,1-4 beta glucan\" does not exactly match any of the existing terms in your database. While \"β-(1,3)-glucan\" and \"β-(1,4)-glucan\" are present, \"1-3,1-4 beta glucan\" refers specifically to a mixed-linkage glucan containing both β-(1,3) and β-(1,4) glycosidic bonds, which is structurally distinct from the pure forms.\n\nAction: I have added \"1-3,1-4 beta glucan\" as a new term in your database."

"The candidate term \"blood group H\" is an exact synonym for \"blood group H determinant\" (UUID: 33654432-0fbb-5d63-964b-04779c68d99e) in your database. I have mapped \"blood group H\" to this existing term."

Processing term: blood group H disaccharide
"The candidate term \"blood group H disaccharide\" does not exactly match any of the existing terms in your database, as the closest matches are for trisaccharide or determinant forms, not specifically a disaccharide. Therefore, I recommend adding \"blood group H disaccharide\" as a new term."

Processing term: blood group H type 1
"The candidate term \"blood group H type 1\" is an exact synonym of the existing term \"blood group H type-1\" (UUID: fff47803-9624-5c8b-b6ac-f54c493cd27c) in the database. Therefore, it should be mapped to this existing term."

"The candidate term \"human natural killer-1\" is an exact synonym for \"HNK-1\" (Term UUID: 4aa392ab-169b-5da1-86a0-bb18312dba93). Therefore, it should be mapped to the existing term \"HNK-1\" in the database."

Processing term: sialyl 6-sulfo LacNAc
"The candidate term \"sialyl 6-sulfo LacNAc\" does not exactly match any of the existing terms in the database. While \"α2-6-sialylated 6-sulfo-LacNAc\" is similar, it specifies the sialylation linkage, which is not explicit in the candidate term. Therefore, \"sialyl 6-sulfo LacNAc\" should be added as a new term."

Processing term: GalNAc disialyl Lc4 hexasaccharide
"The candidate term \"GalNAc disialyl Lc4 hexasaccharide\" does not closely match any of the existing terms in your database.

Processing term: Lewis a- Lewis X hybrid antigen
"The candidate term \"Lewis a- Lewis X hybrid antigen\" does not exactly match any of the existing terms in your database. While \"Lewis a\" and \"Lewis x\" are present as individual entries, a hybrid antigen combining both is not represented. Therefore, I have added \"Lewis a- Lewis X hybrid antigen\" as a new term."

Processing term: Lewis a- Lewis X hybrid antigen
"The candidate term \"Lewis a- Lewis X hybrid antigen\" is an exact match to an existing term in the database. Therefore, it should be mapped to the existing term with UUID bf4125e8-7959-4ec2-b67f-ff8d0b0c3a3f."

Processing term: Neu5Gc(a2-3)Gal / monosialoganglioside
"The candidate term \"Neu5Gc(a2-3)Gal / monosialoganglioside\" does not exactly match any of the existing terms in your database. While \"Neu5Gcα2-3Galβ1-4Glc\" is structurally related, it is a trisaccharide, and \"monosialylated ganglioside\" is a broader class. The candidate term specifically refers to a Neu5Gc-containing disaccharide motif in the context of a monosialoganglioside, which is not covered by the existing entries.\n\nAction: I will add \"Neu5Gc(a2-3)Gal / monosialoganglioside\" as a new term in the database."

Processing term: Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal / monosialoganglioside
"The candidate term \"Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal / monosialoganglioside\" is semantically and structurally equivalent to the existing term \"Neu5Acα2-3Gal\" in the database. Therefore, it has been mapped to the existing term with UUID 473ec64b-303a-53b4-842b-2f8156bc19d1."

No new term needs to be added."

Processing term: 6,6'- disulfo sialyl Lewis X
"The candidate term \"6,6'- disulfo sialyl Lewis X\" does not exactly match any of the existing terms in the database. The closest matches are \"6′-sulfo-sialyl Lewis x\" and \"6-sulfo-sialyl Lewis x,\" which refer to monosulfated forms, while the candidate term specifies disulfation at both the 6 and 6' positions. Therefore, I have added \"6,6'- disulfo sialyl Lewis X\" as a new term."

Processing term: disialyl Lewis c
"The candidate term \"disialyl Lewis c\" does not closely match any existing terms in the database, as all potential matches refer to \"Lewis a\" or \"Lewis x\" structures, not \"Lewis c.\" Therefore, \"disialyl Lewis c\" should be added as a new term."

Processing term: sialyl Lewis c
"The candidate term \"sialyl Lewis c\" does not exactly match any of the existing terms in the database, nor is it an exact synonym of any of them. Therefore, it should be added as a new term."

"The candidate term \"3'-sulfo Lewis x\" is an exact match to the existing database term \"3'-sulfo Lewis X\". Therefore, it should be mapped to the existing term with UUID 3c0d59b6-d558-45d7-998e-ea6531a58295."

Processing term: internal Lewis x
"The candidate term \"internal Lewis x\" does not exactly match any existing terms in the database. While it is related to \"Lewis x,\" the qualifier \"internal\" specifies a distinct structural context (i.e., Lewis x motif located internally within a glycan chain rather than at a terminal position). Therefore, I will add \"internal Lewis x\" as a new term."

Processing term: dimeric Lewis x
"The candidate term \"dimeric Lewis x\" is an exact match to an existing term in the database (\"dimeric Lewis x\", UUID: 980d0f39-e1ff-430f-bf65-3008c9cc2fd9). Therefore, it should be mapped to this existing term."

Processing term: 6-sulfo Lewis x
"The candidate term \"6-sulfo Lewis x\" does not exactly match any of the existing terms in the database. It is distinct from \"3'-sulfo Lewis X\" and the disulfo or sialylated variants. Therefore, I will add \"6-sulfo Lewis x\" as a new term in the database."
