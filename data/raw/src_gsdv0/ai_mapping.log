Therefore, \"N-acetyllactosamine (type 2)\" should be added as a new term."

Processing term: N-glycolyl GM2
"The candidate term \"N-glycolyl GM2\" should be added as a new term. It is not an exact synonym or close match to any of the existing terms (such as GM2, which refers to the N-acetyl variant). \"N-glycolyl GM2\" specifically refers to a GM2 ganglioside containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) instead of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), making it structurally distinct. Therefore, it will be added as a new term in the database."

Processing term: N-glycans
"The candidate term \"N-glycans\" is an exact match to an existing term in the database (\"N-glycans\" with UUID: b6aa2621-651c-5dc5-af13-e3dc0b932d37). Therefore, it should be mapped to this existing term."
